# Tell me about your website content

### Throughout the semester we will be working towards creating portfolio sites (or a different personal site).

Create an HTML file from scratch called `index.html` (like we did in class), and add the following content:
* Give your site a title and main heading telling me what type of site it will be. i.e. "Portfolio Site," "My Recipes," 
"Site About My Favorite Country."
* Write a short description about this website and why you want to make it. Is there anything special about it or things 
you're aiming to include?
* Your website will need to have at least 3 pages besides the home page. Make a list of what content will be on these 
three pages. i.e. "Page 1: Art project, Page 2: Game design project" ...etc. Make sure it's formatted correctly for HTML. 
If you don't know exactly what content will be there, that's okay, just get as specific as you can.


You can change this content later, but it's helpful to be keeping this in mind as the semester goes on so that you can 
ask questions as early as possible.
