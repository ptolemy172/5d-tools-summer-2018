		<h1>Shriya Does Artsy Stuff</h1>
		<p>
			This website will act as my portfolio as well as a place where I hope to put all the fun artsy things I do along the way just for fun. I want to explore a lot of different things in the art, dance, and music fields and this will be the one place where I put what I do.
