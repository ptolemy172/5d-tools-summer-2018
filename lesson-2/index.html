		<h1>Rachel's Portfolio</h1>

		<p>I am creating this website in order to display my photography for potential clients. My current website does not look very professional and I'd like to have a great website before I start to apply for my first co-op in the Fall. I want to display several galleries of photos, in addition to the usual contact and personal information that is typically included in portfolio websites.</p>

		<p>The pages will include:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Home page</li>
			<li>Photos</li>
			<li>Contact Information</li>
			<li>About Page</li>
		</ol>
