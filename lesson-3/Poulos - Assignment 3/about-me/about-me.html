	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<h2>Mckenna Poulos</h2>

	<p>I am a first year student at Northestern University. I am majoring in Computer Science and Deisgn. </p> 
	<p>I grew up in Portland, Oregon and have lived their my whole life. I loved living in such a whimsical and lively city and enojoyed spending my free time exploring all the city have to offer. From going to cute coffee shops, walking along the river and seeing live music at local venues, there was always something to do. In additon to city life, Oregon also offered a wide range of outdoorsy activties like hiking through the gorge and swiming in the waterfalls. While spending time in Bosotn has been a great experience, I can't wait to get back to my home of evergreen trees and mountain views.  </p>
