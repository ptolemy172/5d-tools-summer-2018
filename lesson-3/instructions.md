# Create 4 HTML pages from scratch 
(remember to include all the necessary meta information and starting tags).

## You should include:

* 1 home page
* 3 other pages
* Include a title for each of these pages.
* Include a different image on each of these pages (it can be of anything you want, they don't have to relate to the content that you want to include on your final).
* Navigation that can take you to the any given page from any of the pages (this will probably be an unordered list of links).
* Properly linked links and images with files in appropriate folders.
* Your files are local to your computer so your URLs will not look pretty, they will be something like file://blahblah/uglyurls/yourname/my-website.......... This is totally fine for this assignment, when grading I'm looking at the folder structure that you've created.

Upload a folder containing your 4 html files with the proper folder structure inside. _15pts_
