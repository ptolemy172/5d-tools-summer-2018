		<h1>Erin Dooley's Portfolio</h1>

		<p>This webpage will serve as a portfolio that I can use to showcase my work for future co-ops and other opportunities. I am aiming to include
		 both my engineering and art projects, having pictures and descriptions with each. I may also include an "about me" page discussing my hobbies and interests.</p>
